# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-
The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. With the growing number of online transactions, detecting fraud in real-time has become a critical challenge for financial institutions. This project leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and ML algorithms to classify transactions and reduce risks.

✨ Features

📊 Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, scaling, and balancing imbalanced datasets.

🤖 Machine Learning Models – Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

⚡ Imbalanced Data Handling – Uses SMOTE/undersampling/oversampling techniques.

📈 Performance Evaluation – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve.

🔎 Real-time Prediction – Model can classify new transactions as Fraudulent or Legitimate.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

Dataset: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (European card transactions, 2013)
